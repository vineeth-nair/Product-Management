Standup
___________________________________________________

Given situation: 

You are stepping in as Scrum Master for the stand-up today and you have 3 more days for the sprint to end. Your back-end engineer just finished sharing their update ( pick up the analytics ticket, and there are no blockers ). Your QA team member is next in line to share their updates. In JIRA (ticket tracking tool) you notice the following:

A user story that needs to be completed has two back-end tickets assigned to the back-end engineer that just shared their update in “Code Review”. You know from attending previous standups these tickets have been in ‘Code Review’ for 2 days now. These back-end tickets are blocking two front-end tickets ( ‘code-review complete’) from being tested by QA
There is another ticket covering analytics requirements (story points =3), for which development has not yet started and is expected to be completed in this sprint. The ticket cannot be completed by the end of this sprint if it is not picked up for development by the end of today, It has 5 tracking requirements and you realize 2 out of 5 can be downgraded to ‘nice-to-have’ for the launch.
Assumption for exercise-sake: User stories being referred here are related to the product feature (the project you are working on). The tickets are costed and targeted to be completed by the end of this sprint to go live with the product feature. Use the template (provided in the “starter” section) to share your answers.

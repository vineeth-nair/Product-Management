I am glad to share that I have graduated from Udacity’s Product Management Nanodegree program. 
It has been a great learning journey for the last 4 months. I started with a basic knowledge 
of the roles of a PM. But now, I can say that I understand the various organizational functions
and how multidisciplinary the field is.

Through the program, I learned to:
1. Pitch a product vision
2. Run a design sprint
3. Manage a product development process
4. And, to launch the product
